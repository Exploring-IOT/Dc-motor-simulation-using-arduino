      <p>***<em>Business need: - The problem with Static Road Dividers is that the number of lanes on either side of the road is fixed. - Since the resources are limited and population as well as number of cars per family is increasing, there is significant increase in number of cars on roads. - This calls for better utilization of existing resources like number of lanes available. *</em> About the issue: - For example, in any city, there is industrial area or shopping area where the traffic generally flows in one direction in the morning or evening. - The other side of Road divider is mostly either empty or very underutilized. ** shortfalls: - The above said problem is true for peak morning and evening hours. - This results in loss of time for the car owners, traffic jams as well as under utilization of available resources. ** solution: - Our idea is to formulate a mechanism of automated movable road divider that can shift lanes, so that we can have more number of lanes in the direction of the rush. - The cumulative impact of the time and fuel that can be saved by adding even one extra lane to the direction of the rush will be significant. - With the smart application proposed below, we will also eliminate the dependency on manual intervention and manual traffic coordination so that we can have a smarter traffic all over the city. - An Automated movable road divider can provide a solution to the above mentioned problem effectively. - This is possible through IOT. IOT refers to Internet Of Things where the actual Digitalization comes into picture. - Here sensors play a major role. We can achieve this using arduino board. - The sensors placed on the dividers sense the flow of traffic whether flow of traffic is smooth or not? If the flow is smooth on either sides then there is nothing to worry but the lane which is having more traffic, the divider is moved to a certain distance to the smoother lane in order to smoothen the busy lane. **</p>
