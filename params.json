IOT refers to Internet Of Things where the actual Digitalization comes into picture. - Here sensors play a major role. We can achieve this using arduino board. - The sensors placed on the dividers sense the flow of traffic whether flow of traffic is smooth or not? If the flow is smooth on either sides then there is nothing to worry but the lane which is having more traffic, the divider is moved to a certain distance to the smoother lane in order to smoothen the busy lane. **\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n//[divider concept]\r\n(https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_q4FFIbAZX9akJYWWZNMEgwQjJhcXBqb1FPY1RZOHNJek9j/view?usp=sharing#sthash.KA8UxD0v.dpuf)",
